# Usage
1. Find a working link (for you) here: https://tinyurl.com/kryptonlinks.
2. There are 3 options to open Krypton with.
   about:blank cloaks with an about:blank URL
   blob:https cloaks with a blob:https followed by a temporary URL
   data:text works by copying to clipboard a data:text URL of Krypton which is openable (html wont allow opening data:text URLs automatically)
3. clicking any of them will lead to a 404 page.
4. type anywhere on the screen "404pnf" and click right shift. If it doesn't work, you typoed or started typing too early.
